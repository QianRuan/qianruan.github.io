My name is Qian Ruan（阮倩）. I am a doctoral researcher at the [Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab (UKP)](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) at [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/), supervised by [Prof. Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/head_ukp/index.en.jsp).

Previously, I obtained my Master's degree from Technical University of Berlin (TUB), following the Data Science and Engineering track. Meanwhile, I worked on hierarchical modeling and text summarization as a student research asisitant in Prof. Georg Rehm's Group at German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). I hold both a B.Sc. in business informatics from TUB and a B.A. in German Literarture and Linguistics from Peking University (PKU).

My current research interests focus on natural language processing and natural language generation, particularly in language modeling, text summarization and text generation.
