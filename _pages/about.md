My name is Qian Ruan. I am a doctoral researcher at the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab (UKP) at Technical University of Darmstadt, supervised by Prof. Iryna Gurevych.

Previously, I obtained my Master's degree from Technical University of Berlin (TUB), following the Data Science and Engineering track. Meanwhile, I worked on hierarchical modeling and text summarization as a student research asisitant in Prof. Georg Rehm's Group at German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). I hold both a B.Sc. in business informatics from TUB and a B.A. in German Literarture and Linguistics from Peking University (PKU).

My current research interests focus on natural language processing and natural language generation, particularly in language modeling, text summarization and text generation.
