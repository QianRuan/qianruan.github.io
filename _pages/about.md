My name is Qian Ruan（阮倩）. I am a doctoral researcher at the [Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab (UKP)](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) at [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/), supervised by [Prof. Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/head_ukp/index.en.jsp).

Previously, I obtained my Master's degree from [Technical University of Berlin (TUB)](https://www.tu.berlin/), following the [Data Science and Engineering track](https://www.analytics.tu-berlin.de/data_analytics_lab/data_science_and_engineering_track/). Meanwhile, I worked on hierarchical modeling and text summarization as a student research assistant in [Prof. Georg Rehm](http://georg-re.hm/)'s Group at [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/web). I hold both a B.Sc. in business informatics from [TUB](https://www.tu.berlin/) and a B.A. in German Literature and Linguistics from [Peking University (PKU)](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).

My current research interests focus on natural language processing and natural language generation, particularly in language modeling, text summarization and text generation.
